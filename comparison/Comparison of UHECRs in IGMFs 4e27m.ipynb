    "## Ultra high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) in intergalactic magnetic fields (IGMFs)\n",
    "\n",
    "Introduction into IGMFs is cpoied from Schlegel et al. (2020): \"The question of the generation and maintenance of large-scale magnetic fields in the Universe is still highly debated and unsolved. The existence of intergalactic, turbulent magnetic fields has two evolutionary scenarios: Either, they result from the evolution of primordial fields under the influence of structure formation or, they are generated by the galactic outflow of magnetic fields by winds (e.g. Kronberg (1994); Grasso & Rubinstein (2001); Kulsrud & Zweibel (2008)). Both the supercluster medium and the large-scale structures of our Universe are hardly constrained by observations. \n",
    "\n",
    "The two different scenarios may cause huge differences with respect to the magnetic field strength (Hackstein et al. 2018). Currently, only upper limits of about a few nG constrains the field strength in the voids (Pshirkov et al. 2016; Ade, P. A. R. et al. 2016). Stronger constraints can in principle be derived from the observation of gamma-ray induced cascades (Neronov et al. 2013) - it is not clear, however, how large the influence of the pair instability during the propagation of the electron-positron pairs are not well-quantified at this point (Broderick et al. 2012).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following, we suppose for simplicity that a uniform isotropic turbulent magnetic field is present within\n",
    "these large-scale structures and consider the propagation of individual CRs through these fields. The field will be characterized as follows:\"\n",

    "For PropPy Simulations, the step size shown here does not appear to have a noticeable effect on the diffusion coefficients. The steps can be significantly larger than the correlation length of the turbulence and than the gyration radius of the particles. This is not surprising, since in the correlated random walk in Cartesian coordinates used in PropPy for isotropic turbulence, the gyration motion and the turbulence does not need to be resolved.\n",
    "\n",
    "For CRPropa, on the other hand, the resolution plays a significant role in the integration of the particle trajectories. Only for small step sizes, when both the relevant scales of turbulence and gyration motion are resolved, does the diffusion coefficient converge against the prediction of the theory. As soon as the step size becomes larger than the correlation length of the turbulence, diffusion coefficients are wrong. See the appendix in Reichherzer 2020 for a detailed discussion of this effect. If the step size is larger than the gyroradius, the diffusion coefficients increase again, because now averaging over the large steps becomes too large.\n",
