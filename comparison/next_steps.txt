Comparison between CRPropa and RWPropa

- CRPropa BP convergence tests for step size
  - choose intervall that shows convergence for step_size < gyro_radius and that shows issues at step_size > l_c
  - make simulations and save sim times besides results
  - plot kappa vs step sizes
  - determine correct (converged) diffusion coefficient
  
- Repeat tests for CK

- Repeat tests for RWPropa

-> Rsults
  - running diffusion coefficients as functions of time for different step sizes and different sim methods
  - kappas vs step sizes and color coded with the time
  - deviation plot as functions of step sizes
  - deviations as functions of simulation times
    - color code the different step sizes and use different markers for different simulation methods
    -> also usefull for phd thesis

Current setup with sim.py and tutorial 7 serves as a basis and demonstrates the huge advantage of rwpropa (use 100 particles instead)
